    <h1>Blockchain Secure Software Assets Management (BloSS@M)</h1>
    <p>
      The goal of BloSS@M project is to demonstrate, through a proof of concept application, 
      the applicability of permission-based distributed ledger system to support the 
      President’s Management Agenda (PMA) and the Quality Service Management Offices (QSMO) 
      missions by enabling the upwards aggregation of software assets acquisition at USG level
      and downwards distribution, sharing and recycling of these software assets among different
      USG departments and agencies. Additionally, the project aims to demonstrate that the 
      blockchain-based system created to address the PMA meets the Federal Information System 
      Management Act (FISMA) requirement while automating a large percentage of the assessment 
      and authorization (A&A) process to ease the system’s Authorization to Operate (ATO) and 
      to support continuous monitoring process. The outcome of the project, the Blockchain-based 
      Secure Software Assets Management (BloSS@M), will be an implementation of a fully decentralized, 
      intrusion-tolerant software assets management system leveraging multiple novel techniques 
      (e.g., permission-based blockchains, SWID tag, NGAC). 
     </p>
     <p>
      The permission-based blockchain system has unique properties, including high throughput and 
      scalability and modular design and implementation.
